# Hashing_directory_scanner

This C program iterates through all the files in the specified directory and in its subdirectories, calculating the hash (CRC32 or Magma in the add-in mode) of all its available files.

This program can be used as a simple antivirus scanner that searches for viruses by their signatures.

`test` folder and file `1.txt` created specifically to demonstrate the capabilities of the program.
